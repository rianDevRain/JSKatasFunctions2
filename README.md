# JSKatasFunctions2
 Assignment for Kenzie
Overview
A kata is an individual exercise where you practice a programming skill through repetition. Today you will practice using JavaScript loops and functions. These katas start out trivial and ramp up in difficulty.

The primary goals of this collection of katas are:

To get you accustomed to writing and calling functions which accept arguments (input values) and return results.
To get you accustomed to breaking down a problem into the various parts of a FOR loop.
You will use the return keyword for the output of your function. Unlike other katas we've done up until now, most of these build on each other, which means that you will need to complete them in order.

Note that anything I say below about functions also applies to methods (we'll talk about the difference soon).

The Katas
1. Add (1 point)
Write a function named "add" which takes two arguments (as input variables) and returns their sum.

You may use built-in operators in order to finish this kata.

For example, calling add(2, 4) should return a result of 6.

2. Multiply (2 points)
Write a function named "multiply" which takes two arguments (as input variables) and returns their product.

You may not use built-in math operators or functions (such as the * multiplication operator). Instead, you will use a WHILE loop which calls your add function from the first kata.

For example, calling multiply(6, 4) should return a result of 24, which could be expressed by adding 6 to itself 4 times:

6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24
3. Power/Exponentiation (2 points)
Write a function named "power" which takes two arguments ( x and n) and returns the the result of raising x to the nth power.

You may not use built-in math operators or functions (such as the * multiplication operator), or the ** operator for power/exponentiation). Instead, you will re-use functions you wrote in earlier katas to write this function.

For example, if we called power(2, 8), we should return 256 by multiplying 2 by itself 8 times:

2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 256
And to achieve the correct result for power(3, 4), we would want to multiply 3 by itself 4 times:

3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81
See this Wikipedia article for more details on exponentiation.

4. Factorial (2 points)
Write a function named "factorial" which takes a single argument and returns the factorial of that value.

You may not use built-in math operators or functions (such as the * multiplication operator). Instead, you will re-use functions you wrote in earlier katas to write this function.

A factorial multiplies a given number by every number below it. For example, "5 factorial" (usually symbolized by 5! in Mathematics) would be:

5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
For example, calling factorial(4) should return a result of 24.

Bonus: Fibonacci (3 points)
Write a function named "Fibonacci" which takes an argument n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

You may not use built-in math operators or functions (such as the * multiplication operator). Instead, you will use functions you wrote in earlier katas to write this function.

For example, calling fibonacci(8) should return a result of 13. The Fibonnaci sequence begins:

0  1  1  2  3  5  8  [13]  21
So, the number in brackets is the 8th Fibonacci number in the sequence above (counting from the left).

Hints
The answers to most of these katas will look similar. They will typically involve:
declaring a variable to keep track of a final result
writing a WHILE loop to consistently modify the result
returning the result
If you struggle for more than 15 minutes on any one thing, ask for help! This is an exercise in critical thinking, not torture.
